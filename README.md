# Lunastak

Tools for preparing strategic context to feed [Lunastak](https://app.lunastak.io) — an AI coach that turns your strategic thinking into a Decision Stack.

---

## Why this exists

[Lunastak](https://app.lunastak.io) is an AI coach that builds a [Decision Stack](https://thedecisionstack.com) — a five-layer strategic artefact from vision through execution. The app generates one from a guided conversation.

But conversation isn't always the right starting point. If you've already done the thinking — in decks, transcripts, planning sessions, half-finished memos — you don't want to recap it from memory. You want to feed Lunastak what you've already got.

This plugin does that. The skill extracts and organises strategic context from whatever you bring into your Claude Code session, then exports it as a JSON [context bundle](https://lunastak.io/docs/context-bundles) you import into [app.lunastak.io](https://app.lunastak.io).

---

## Quick start

Add the marketplace, install the plugin:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add lunastak/tools
claude plugin install lunastak@lunastak-tools
```

In any Claude Code session:

```
/lunastak:decision-stack
```

Or describe what you want — the skill auto-triggers on phrases like *"prep my decision stack"*, *"build a context bundle"*, or *"organise my strategic thinking"*.

The skill is also listed on [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/lunastak/tools/decision-stack) — browse or install it from there.

## First time using Claude Code?

If you haven't installed Claude Code yet, the path is short.

1. Install Claude Code: [code.claude.com](https://code.claude.com).
2. Open a terminal anywhere.
3. Run the install commands above.
4. Start a session with `claude` and type `/lunastak:decision-stack`.

Try this as a first prompt:

> *"I want to prep a Decision Stack context bundle. I've got a vision doc and the transcript from our last quarterly planning session."*

The skill opens by asking what you're bringing, then extracts strategic material organised by the [ten strategic areas](https://lunastak.io/docs/decision-stack). When coverage is sufficient, run `/lunastak:export` to produce the bundle.

---

## What are skills and commands?

**Skills** are domain knowledge. They teach Claude what a Decision Stack is, how strategic material is structured, and how to extract context without straying into advising. Auto-loaded — Claude matches your wording against the skill's description.

**Commands** are workflows you invoke. Three of them: start a session, export the bundle, resume from a saved bundle.
